# Current bottlenecks

The live counts are generated in
[`status/PROJECT_STATUS.generated.md`](status/PROJECT_STATUS.generated.md).
The formal manifest has **1,041/1,041 strict matches**. V81 added raw
byte-exact assembly-reconstruction evidence for the final 20 complete spans,
totaling 71,384 bytes, and generated an audited zero-entry frontier map.

## Function frontier — closed

- All audited function rows now have complete-boundary, immutable matching
  evidence. The checked zero-entry map is
  [`../analysis/matching/hunt1041-v81-frontier-map-0.tsv`](../analysis/matching/hunt1041-v81-frontier-map-0.tsv).
- The remaining work is no longer function discovery or per-function matching;
  it is coherent source ownership and whole-program identity.

## Build-ready source

All audited entries have a behavioral/source model, but that does not yet prove
coherent historical translation units. The main remaining work is:

- freeze global ownership and exact PS2-width types;
- separate structural-lift corridors into proven object boundaries;
- reproduce visibility, common/BSS behavior, inline decisions and C++ ABI
  ownership;
- distinguish readable recovered source from exact assembly-only evidence.

## Whole-program identity

Even after every function is `MATCHING`, an identical ELF still requires:

- exact old PS2LIB/PS2SDK-era archive revisions and selected members;
- exact application linker script, section placement and object/library order;
- data/rodata/string-pool/vtable layout and relocations;
- exact binutils patch level;
- reproducible SJCRUNCH2/LZO packing.

These gates are intentionally enforced by the blocked `make elf` target. The
full sequence is documented in [`REPRODUCTION.md`](REPRODUCTION.md).
